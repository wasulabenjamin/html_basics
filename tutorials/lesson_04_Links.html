	<h1>Text Links</h1>
	<!--
		A webpage can contain various links that take us directly to other web pages or resources and even specific parts of 
		a given page. A hyperlink is a specific type of link that allows users to navigate from one web page or resource to 
		another by clicking on it. 
		You can create hyperlinks using text or images available on a webpage. A hyperlink is specified using HTML tag <a>. 
		This tag is called anchor tag and anything between the opening <a> tag and the closing </a> tag becomes part of the 
		link and a user can click that part to reach the linked document.

		Target attribute of anchor Tag
		The target attribute of the anchor tag in HTML specifies where to open the linked document. 
		This attribute is used to open linked document in new browser tab, same tab or parent frame depending upon the need.

		Use of Base Path
		When you link HTML documents related to the same website, it is not required to give a complete URL for every link. 
		You can get rid of it if you use <base> tag in your HTML document header. This tag is used to give a base path for 
		all the links. So your browser will concatenate given relative path to this base path and will make a complete URL.

		Linking to a Page Section
		We can also use href attribute to navigate to a different section within the same page. 
		We provide '#idofsection' inside href to navigate section of our need.

		Setting Link Text Colors
		You can set colors of your links, active links and visited links using link, alink and vlink attributes of body tag.

		HTML Downloadable Links
		You can create text link to make your PDF, or DOC or ZIP files downloadable. 
		This is achieved by using download attribute of anchor tag.
