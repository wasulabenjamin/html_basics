	<h1>Basic Tags</h1>
	<!--
		HTML tags are the fundamental elements of HTML used for defining the structure of the document. These are letters 
		or words enclosed by angle brackets (< and >).
		Usually, most of the HTML tags contain an opening and a closing tag. Each tag has a different meaning, and the 
		browser reads the tags and displays the contents enclosed by them accordingly.
	-->
	
	<h2>Heading Tags</h2>
	<!--
		Heading tags are used to define headings of documents. You can use different sizes for your headings. 
		HTML also has six levels of headings, which use the elements h1, h2, h3, h4, h5 and h6.
		While displaying any heading, the browser adds one line before and one line after that heading.

		Following HTML code demonstrates various levels of headings:
	-->
	<h1>This is heading 1</h1>
	<h2>This is heading 2</h2>
	<h3>This is heading 3</h3>
	<h4>This is heading 4</h4>
	<h5>This is heading 5</h5>
	<h6>This is heading 6</h6>

	<!--
		Line Break Tag: Whenever you use the <br/> element, anything following it starts from the next line.
		This tag is an example of an empty element, where you do not need opening and closing tags, as there is nothing to 
		go in between them.
	-->
	<br/>
	<br/>
	<br/>

 	<h2>Horizonal Rule Tag</h2>
 	<!--
		The horizontal rule (<hr>) tag displays a horizonal line. A horizontal line visually breaks up sections of a 
		document. The <hr> tag creates a line from the current position in the document to the right margin and breaks the 
		line accordingly.

		The following example draws a horizontal line between two paragraphs:
 	-->
	<p>This is paragraph one and should be on top</p>
  <hr/>
  <p>This is paragraph two and should be at bottom</p>

  <h2>Preserve Formatting Tag</h2>
  <!--
		The <pre> tag is used to preserve the formatting. Whenever you want to display content on the webpage exactly in the 
		same format as it was written in the HTML document, you can use the <pre> tag. It preserves the formatting of source 
		code, including line breaks and indentation.
  	
  	The following example demonstrates the use of the pre tag:
  -->
  <pre>
    function testFunction( strText ){
       alert (strText)
    }
  </pre>

  <h2>Listing Tags</h2>
  <!--
		The <ul> and <ol> tags create the unordered and ordered listings, and to display list items, the <li> tag is used.
  	
  	The following example demonstrates the use of listing tags:
  -->
  <p>Unordered List</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Item 1</li>
    <li>Item 2</li>
    <li>Item 3</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Ordered List</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Item 1</li>
    <li>Item 2</li>
    <li>Item 3</li>
  </ol>  

	<h1>Elements</h1>
	<!--
		HTML elements are the basic building blocks to create a web page; they are created with the help of an opening tag, 
		content, and ending tag. HTML documents consist of a tree of these elements, and they specify how HTML documents 
		should be built, and what kind of content should be placed within various parts of an HTML document.
	
		Some of the examples of HTML elements are as follows:
	-->
	<p>This is paragraph content.</p>
	<h1>This is heading content.</h1>
	<div>This is division content.</div>

	<h2>Nested HTML Elements</h2>
	<!--
		HTML allows nesting of elements. The nested elements are created by placing one or more HTML elements inside a HTML 
		element. Where the container element can be considered as a parent element and others are as child elements.
		The child elements are nested inside the parent element. We can have multiple levels of nesting; however, it 
		requires some guidelines to follow:
		- Every opening tag must have a corresponding closing tag.
		- The closing tag of the parent element must come after the closing tag of the child element.
		- The nested elements must be valid HTML elements.
		
		In the below example, we are nesting the italicized element within the h1 element and underlined element within 
		the paragraph element.
	-->
	<h1>This is an <i>italic</i> heading.</h1>
  <p>This is an <u>underlined</u> paragraph.</p>

  <h2>HTML Void Elements</h2>
  <!--
  	HTML void elements are those elements that don't require closing tags. These tags don't have any content model and 
  	even don't allow nesting of elements. The void elements are also known as empty or self-closing elements.
	  Some of the void elements are such as <img>, <hr>, and <br> elements.

		img: Used for inserting images within HTML documents.
		hr: It displays a horizontal rule.
		br: It is used to provide a line break.
		source: It is used for embedding media resources like audio and video.
  -->

  <h2>Attributes With HTML Elements</h2>
	<!--
		Attributes can be placed with an opening tag by using the pairs of attribute name and value.
  	Multiple attributes can be separated with a space.

		The following statement demonstrates the use of two attributes src and alt with an HTML element img:
	-->
	<img src="logo.jpg" alt="TutorialsPoint Logo">

	<h2>Mandatory Closing HTML Elements</h2>
	<!--
		HTML elements that are opened must be closed. Only the void elements like img, hr, br, etc. do not require closing 
		tags; other elements such as p and h1 require closing tags after the content part.
	
		If any HTML element does not include a closing tag, it may not cause an error, and some content may still display 
		properly. However, never miss the closing tag, as it may lead to unexpected and inconsistent results.
	-->

	<h1>Attributes</h1>
	<!--
		HTML attributes are special words that provide additional information to an HTML element. Attributes are placed 
		inside the element's opening tag, and they are used to configure or adjust the element's behavior. All attributes 
		are made up of two parts: a name and a value. 

		Name: The attribute name is the keyword, also known as the attribute identifier, which defines a specific 
		characteristic for the element in which it is using. For example, the paragraph, p, element (in the below-given 
		example) has an attribute "align", which defines the alignment of the paragraph on the page.
		
		Value: The attribute value is the data or information that defines the value to be set for that attribute. The 
		value is assigned within the double quotes. For example, "left", "center", or "right" can be assigned to the "align" 
		attribute with the paragraph tag (as shown in the below example).
	
		Rules and Characteristics
		The following are the rules and characteristics of HTML attributes; you should follow while using attributes with 
		HTML elements:
		- Attributes are optional; you can use them to provide additional information about an HTML element.
		- Attributes have name and value pairs, but some of the attributes do not require any value; those are known as 
			Boolean attributes.
		- A HTML element can have multiple attributes, and they should be separated by spaces.
		- Attributes should always be written with the opening tag.
		- W3C recommends using attributes in lowercase and keeping the value in quotes.

		Below is the syntax of an element HTML having attribute:
	-->
	<p align="right">Right aligned paragraph</p>
	<p align="left">Left aligned paragraph</p>
	<p align="center">Center aligned paragraph</p>


	<h2>HTML Core Attributes</h2>
	<!--
		The four core attributes that can be used on the majority of HTML elements (although not all) are :
		
		The id Attribute, The id attribute of an HTML tag can be used to uniquely identify any element within a HTML page.
		There are two primary reasons that you might want to use an id attribute on an element − 
		- If an element carries an id attribute as a unique identifier, it is possible to identify just that element and its 
			content
		- If you have two elements of the same name within a Web page (or style sheet), you can use the id attribute to 
			distinguish between elements that have the same name.

		The title Attribute, The title attribute gives a suggested title for the element. The syntax for the title attribute 
		is similar as explained for id attribute. The behavior of this attribute will depend upon the element that carries 
		it, although it is often displayed as a tooltip when the cursor comes over the element or while the element is 
		loading.
		
		The class Attribute, The class attribute specifies one or more CSS classes for an HTML element. Multiple classes can 
		be used on a single element with this attribute. The value of this attribute is a space-separated list of class 
		names if you are specifying multiple classes.

		The style Attribute, The style attribute allows you to write inline CSS rules for an element.

  <p style="font-family:arial; color:greenyellow;">Welcome to tutorials 1, basics</p>

  <h2>HTML Internationalization Attributes</h2>
  <!--
		There are three internationalization attributes, which are available for most (although not all) XHTML elements.

		The dir Attribute 
		This attribute allows you to indicate to the browser about the direction in which the text should flow. 
		The dir attribute can take one of two values, ltr (Left to right, the default value) or rtl (Right to left)
		When dir attribute is used within the <html> tag, it determines how text will be presented within the entire 
		document. When used within another tag, it controls the text's direction for just the content of that tag.

		The lang Attribute
		The lang attribute allows you to indicate the main language used in a document, but this attribute was kept in HTML 
		only for backwards compatibility with earlier versions of HTML. This attribute has been replaced by the xml:lang 
		attribute in new XHTML documents. The values of the lang attribute are ISO-639 standard two-character language codes.
		Check HTML Language Codes: ISO 639 for a complete list of language codes.

		HTML Boolean Attributes
		Boolean attributes represent true and false values and do not require any value with the attribute name. 
		To set the true value, you need to write the attribute's name, and to set it false, the attribute should be omitted 
		altogether. Here are some Boolean attributes:–
			disabled
			readonly
			required
			inert
			autocomplete

		xml:lang Attribute
		The xml:lang attribute is the XHTML replacement for the lang attribute. The value of the xml:lang attribute should 
		be an ISO-639 country code.

		HTML Generic Attributes
		Here's a table of some other attributes that are readily usable with many of the HTML tags.
			- align:	right, left, center	
				Horizontally aligns tags
			- valign:	top, middle, bottom
				Vertically aligns tags within an HTML element.
			- bgcolor:	numeric, hexidecimal, RGB values
				Places a background color behind an element
			- background:	URL
				Places a background image behind an element
			- id:	User Defined
				Names an element for use with Cascading Style Sheets.
			- class:	User Defined
				Classifies an element for use with Cascading Style Sheets.
			- width:	Numeric Value	
				Specifies the width of tables, images, or table cells.
			- height:	Numeric Value	
				Specifies the height of tables, images, or table cells.
			- title:	User Defined	
				"Pop-up" title of the elements.

		Best Practices for Using HTML Attributes
		There are certain practices you should follow to use attributes on any element:
		- Write Values in Quotes: You should always write the attribute values in single or double quotes.
		- Use Lowercase: HTML is case-insensitive, but the good practice is to write the HTML attribute in lowercase.

  <p dir="ltr">Left to right paragraph example</p>
  <p dir="rtl">Right to left paragraph example</p>

  <form>
	  <label for="user_name">Input User Name:</label>
	  <input type="text" id="user_ds" name="user_ds" placeholder="disabled" disabled>
	  <input type="text" id="user_ro" name="user_ro" placeholder="readonly" readonly>
	  <input type="text" id="user_rq" name="user_rq" placeholder="required" required>
	  <input type="text" id="user_in" name="user_in" placeholder="inert" inert>
	  <input type="text" id="user_ac" name="user_ac" placeholder="autocomplete" autocomplete>
	  <input type="submit">
	</form>

	<h1>Headings</h1>
	<!--
		The headings are defined with headings tags (<h1> to <h6>). It is important to use heading tags to show the content 
		structure on a webpage. HTML has a different level of heading tags. The hierarchy determines the importance of 
		content and aids in creating a clear information flow for both users and search engines.
	-->
	<h1>This is Heading 1 (H1 Tag)</h1>
  <h2>This is Heading 2 (H2 Tag)</h2>
  <h3>This is Heading 3 (H3 Tag)</h3>
  <h4>This is Heading 4 (H4 Tag)</h4>
  <h5>This is Heading 5 (H5 Tag)</h5>
  <h6>This is Heading 6 (H6 Tag)</h6>

  <h2>Using HTML Tags Within Heading Tags</h2>
	<!--
		HTML headings (h1 to h6) serve as the main titles and subheadings for content organization. 
		Within these heading tags, you can use various other HTML tags to enhance and structure your content effectively.
		
		The <span> Tag
		You can use the <span> tag to apply inline styles or classes to specific portions of the text within a heading.
		This allows for custom styling of text within the heading.

		The <a>Tag for Links
		To create a link within a heading, use the <a> tag.
		This is useful for headings that lead to other pages or sections of your website.

		The <em> and <strong> Tags
		These tags are used for emphasizing text within headings.
		The <em> tag italicizes the text, while <strong> makes it bold.

		The <sup> and <sub> Tags
		In heading, to include superscript or subscript text within a heading, use <sup> and <sub>.

		The <abbr> Tag for Abbreviations
		When you need to include an abbreviation or acronym in a heading, use the <abbr> tag.
		It often provides a tooltip with the full meaning.

		The <mark> Tag
		Use the <mark> tag to highlight specific text within a heading. 
		It's often used to indicate search results or selected portions of text.

	<h1>Paragraph</h1>
	<!--
		HTML paragraphs are block-level elements that are used to structure and format text content on a webpage. 
		A paragraph is basically a collection of words and punctuation together. It allows us to organize and present 
		textual information in a coherent and readable manner. The HTML <p> tag is used to create a paragraph element.

		Reason to Use Paragraphs
		Paragraphs typically create space above and below the text, separating it from surrounding content. 
		They can be styled using CSS to control aspects such as font size, color, alignment, and spacing. 
		In web development, paragraphs play a crucial role in conveying information effectively, enabling clear 
		communication, and enhancing the overall user experience on a website.
	-->
	<p>
		It is important to take care of the pain itself, and it will be followed by the growth of the patient, but at the 
		same time it will happen that there is a lot of work and pain. For to come to the smallest detail, no one should 
		practice any kind of work unless he derives some benefit from it. Do not be angry with the pain in the reprimand in 
		the pleasure he wants to be a hair from the pain in the hope that there is no breeding. Unless they are blinded by 
		lust, they do not come out; they are in fault who abandon their duties and soften their hearts, that is toil.

  </style>
  <p class="special">This is the first paragraph, and it is special.</p>
  <p>This is the second paragraph.</p>
  <p class="special">This is the third paragraph, and it is special.</p>

	<h1>Block</h1>
	<!--
		HTML block elements are used to create the logical and semantic layout of a web page. They help to organize the 
		content into meaningful sections and make it easier for browsers, search engines, and site visitors to understand 
		the structure and meaning of different parts of the web page. 
		Inline elements are used to make useful block elements, like adding anchor links.

		There are various tags that you can use to create blocks, such as <div>, <p>, <table>, and so on.
		All the HTML elements can be categorized into two categories: Block-level Elements and Inline Elements
		
		HTML Block-level Elements
		Block-level elements start on a new line, and anything that follows them appears on the next line. 
		These elements may contain margins to add some space before and after. 
		These elements take up the full width of their parent elements by default; you may set their width by using the 
		CSS width property.
		The following table has the list of all block-level elements:
			<address>	<article>	<aside>		<blockquote>	<canvas>	<dd>	<div>		<dl>		<dt>	<fieldset>	<figcaption>	
			<figure>	<footer>	<form>		<h1 - h6>			<header>	<hr>	<li>		<main>	<nav>	<noscript>	<ol>	
			<p>				<pre>			<section>	<table>				<tfoot>		<ul>	<video>

		HTML Inline Elements
		Inline elements can appear within the same line and do not start a new line on their own.
		The following table lists down all the inline elements −
			<a>			<abbr>	<acronym>	<b>		<bdo>		<big>				<br>			<button>	<cite>	<code>	<dfn>			<em>	
			<i>			<img>		<input>		<kbd>	<label>	<map>				<object>	<output>	<q>			<samp>	<script>	<select>	
			<small>	<span>	<strong>	<sub>	<sup>		<textarea>	<time>		<tt>			<var>

		Grouping Block and Inline Elements
		Block-level and inline elements can be grouped using the <div> tag. 
		The <div> tag is a block-level element that plays a big role in grouping various other HTML tags and applying CSS to 
		groups of elements.
	-->
	<!-- First group of tags -->
 	<div style="background-color:yellow">
    <h4>This is first group</h4>
    <p>Following is a list of vegetables</p>
    <ul>
       <li>Beetroot</li>
       <li>Ginger</li>
       <li>Potato</li>
       <li>Radish</li>
    </ul>
 	</div>
 	<!-- Second group of tags -->
 	<div style="background-color:cyan">
    <h4>This is second group</h4>
    <p>Following is a list of fruits</p>
    <ul>
       <li>Apple</li>
       <li>Banana</li>
       <li>Mango</li>
       <li>Strawberry</li>
    </ul>
 	</div>

	<h1>Style Sheet</h1>
	<!--
		CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a tool that defines how web documents look on screens or in print. Since its 
		introduction in 1994, the W3C has encouraged the use of style sheets for web design. CSS lets you control the 
		presentation of your content, whether it's on a screen, in print, or for accessibility, making web design more 
		flexible and efficient.
		
		Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) provide easy and effective alternatives to specify various attributes for the HTML 
		tags. Using CSS, you can specify a number of style properties for a given HTML element.
		
		Each property has a name and a value, separated by a colon (:). 
		Each property declaration is separated by a semicolon (;).

		There are three ways to include CSS in your HTML document:
			- External CSS: Define style sheet rules in a separate .css file and then include that file in your HTML document 
				using HTML <link> tag.
			- Internal CSS: Define style sheet rules in the header section of the HTML document using <style> tag.
			- Inline CSS: Define style sheet rules directly along-with the HTML elements using style attribute.
	-->
	<p>Example to Use Internal CSS in HTML</p>
	<style type="text/css">
    .red {
      color: red;
    }
    .thick {
      font-size: 20px;
    }
    .green {
      color: green;
    }
  </style>
  <p class="red">This is red</p>
  <p class="thick">This is thick</p>
  <p class="green">This is green</p>
  <p class="thick green">This is thick and green</p>

  <hr>
	<p>Example to Use Inline CSS in HTML</p>
  <p style="color:red;">This is red</p>
  <p style="font-size:20px;">This is thick</p>
  <p style="color:green;">This is green</p>
  <p style="color:green;font-size:20px;">This is thick and green</p>

	<h1>Formatting</h1>
	<!--
		HTML formatting defines the way of content representation on the webpage to improve the readability, to give the 
		semantic meaning, and to improve visual styling. HTML formatting is done by using HTML physical and logical tags.

		Physical Tags:
		These tags are used to give the visual appearance to the textual content.

		Logical Tags:
		These tags are used to give logical and semantic meaning to the textual content.
		There are a few logical tags that are used for screen readers, but the impact of those tags is visible on the 
		browsers.
		
		Without formatting, nothing looks good or soothing to our eyes. But HTML formatting is not only for soothing the eye 
		or making textual content attractive. There are few reasons to do the HTML formatting.

		HTML formatting is useful in many aspects:
		- The appearance of any text provides a clear view of the content intent, such as highlighting the keywords, putting 
			meaningful information in the quotations, underlining the main sentence, etc.
		- Formatting helps search engines understand the content structure and is also helpful for search engine 
			optimization.
		- Formatting improves the visual layout and improves the readability of the content.

		The following table has a list of common HTML formatting tags that are used for text formatting:
		Physical Tags
			<b>.......	This tag is used to make the text bold.
			<i>.......	This tag is used to make the text italic.
			<small>...	This tag is used to make the text smaller.
			<u>.......	This tag is used to underline text.
		Logical Tags
			<strong>..	This tag is used to bold text and give it semantic importance.
			<em>......	This tag is used to italicize text and give it semantic emphasis.
		Other Tags
			<sup>.....	This tag is used to make superscript text (slightly above the normal line).
			<sub>.....	This tag is used to make subscript text (slightly below the normal line).
			<ins>.....	This tag is used to indicate that content has been added (typically underlined).
			<del>.....	This tag is used to indicate that content has been deleted (typically struck through).
			<mark>....	This tag is used to highlight text with a yellow background.

	<p>Example of a <mark>marked</mark> text</p>

	<h1>Quotation</h1>
	<!--
		HTML quotations allow you to include and format quoted text within your web content. 
		HTML provides tags such as <blockquote>, <q>, <cite>, <address>, <bdo>, and <abbr> to structure and style quotes.

		These quotation tags help maintain proper formatting and semantics, enhancing the presentation and meaning of quoted 
		content on web pages. Incorporating quotes is essential for conveying information accurately and providing a 
		well-organized reading experience for users.

		The following are the quotation elements that are used to insert and display quotations on the webpage:
			<q>...........	Defines a short inline quotation.
			<blockquote>..	Defines a block-level indented quotation.
			<cite>........	Specifies a reference to the title of a creative work, such as books or articles.
			<address>.....	Defines contact information.
			<bdo>.........	Overrides text direction.
			<abbr>........	Defines an abbreviation or acronym.
	-->

	<p>Example of a <abbr>abbreviation</abbr> quotation</p>

	<h1>Color</h1>
	<!--
		HTML colors are a way of specifying the appearance of web elements. They are very important aspects of web design, 
		as they not only enhance the visual appeal but also influence user behavior. They are also used to evoke emotions 
		and highlight important content.

		In HTML, colors are generally defined for backgrounds, borders, and texts.
		To specify the colors, the style attribute of HTML elements is used.

		The following three methods are used to set colors in a web page −
			- Color names: We can specify color names directly, like green, blue, or red.
			- Hex codes: A six-digit code representing the amount of red, green, and blue that makes up the color. #000033
			- Color decimal or percentage values; This value is specified using the rgb() property.
	-->
	<p style="background-color: teal;">This paragraph has its background color as <b>Teal</b>.</p>
	<p style="background-color: #FFFF66;">This paragraph has its background color as <b>#FFFF66</b>.</p></p>
	<p style="border: 2.5px solid teal;">This paragraph has its border color as <b>Teal</b>.</p>

	<h1>Image</h1>
	<!--
		HTML images provide visual content for web pages, enhancing user experiences and conveying information. 
		They can be photographs, graphics, icons, or illustrations.
		HTML offers various elements for embedding, manipulating, and controlling images, contributing to the aesthetics and 
		functionality of websites. Understanding image tags, attributes, and responsive design principles is essential for 
		effective web development.

		The following is the basic syntax for HTML images:
			- src: The src attribute defines the path of the image (image URL).
			- alt: The alt attribute defines the alternate text; 
						 if there is a broken link to the image path, the alternate text displays on the webpage.
			- width and height: The width and height attribute define the height and width for the image.

		You can use PNG, JPEG, or GIF image files based on your comfort, but make sure you specify the correct image 
		file name in the src attribute. The image name is always case-sensitive.
		The alt attribute is an optional attribute but recommended as it specifies an alternate text for an image if the 
		image cannot be displayed.

		Bordered Image
		You can specify the border and its thickness in terms of pixels using the border attribute. 
		A thickness of 0 means there is no border around the picture.

		Image Alignement
		By default, the image will align at the left side of the page, but you can use the align attribute to set it in the 
		center or right.

		Animated Images
		You can also use animated images (having .gif extensions) on the webpages. 
		There is no specific attribute required to show animated images; you can simply set the path of the animated image

	<h1>Image Map</h1>
	<!--
		HTML image maps are defined by the <map> tag. An image map enables specific areas of an image to be clickable, 
		acting as links to different destinations.
		By defining various shapes (rectangles, circles, and polygons) within an image, each with its own associated link, 
		developers can create dynamic and interactive visual content that enhances user engagement and navigation.

		Image maps are useful for creating complex navigation, interactive diagrams, or engaging visual experiences, 
		enhancing user engagement and interactivity on web pages. It is useful to create interactive graphics by defining 
		clickable regions within an image. This allows users to interact with different image parts, triggering specific 
		actions or links.

		The <map> tag is used to create a client-side image map, turning specific regions of an image into interactive 
		elements. This allows users to click on different areas of the image, triggering various actions. The <map> element 
		serves as a container for <area> elements, each defining a clickable region with specific attributes.
		When used in conjunction with the <img> tag, the <map> tag establishes a connection between the image and its 
		associated map. This enables web developers to create dynamic and interactive content by defining distinct clickable 
		zones within an image.

		The <area> tag is used within the <map> tag to define clickable regions on an image. 
		It specifies the shape, coordinates, and associated actions for each clickable area.
			<area shape="rect" coords="x1,y1,x2,y2" href="url" alt="Description">

		You can define a circular shape by assigning the circle value to the shape attribute. 
		The circular shape requires center coordinates (x, y) and radius (r) that you can define in coords attribute.
			<area shape="circle" coords="x,y,r" href="url" alt="Description">

		You can define a polygon shape by assigning the poly value to the shape attribute.
		The polygon shape requires a series of coordinates to form the shape that you can define in coords attribute.
		This can be used to create any shape, whether it be a mango or apple.
			<area shape="poly" coords="x1,y1,x2,y2,..,xn,yn" href="url" alt="Description">

		To create an image map in HTML, follow these steps with a code example −
			Step 1: Prepare Your Image
				Begin with the image you want to use as an image map. For this example, we'll use an image file named logo.png. 
				Use the usemap attribute in the <img> tag to link the image to the <map> tag by keeping its value to the name 
				attribute of the <map>:
			Step 2: Define the Image Map
				Use the <map> tag to define the image map and give it a unique name with the name attribute.
			Step 3: Define Clickable Areas
				Within the <map> element, define clickable areas using <area> tags. 
				Specify the shape (rect, circle, or poly), coordinates, and the URL to link to.
