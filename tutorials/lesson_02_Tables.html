	<h1>Tables</h1>
	<!--
		HTML tables represent data, such as text, images, etc. in a structured format with rows and columns. HTML tables 
		offer a visual structure that aids in clarity and comprehension, making them a fundamental element in web 
		development.

		HTML tables are used for various reasons, primarily centered around organizing and presenting data effectively. Some 
		key purposes include:âˆ’
			- Structuring Data: Tables provide a coherent structure for organizing and displaying data, making it easier for 
				users to interpret information.
			- Comparative Presentation: When there is a need to compare different sets of data side by side like difference 
				between two concepts, tables offer a clear and visually accessible format.
			- Tabular Data Representation: Information that naturally fits into rows and columns, such as schedules, 
				statistics, or pricing tables, can be well-represented using HTML tables.
		
		You can create a table in HTML by using the <table> tag along with several tags that define the structure and 
		content inside the table. The primary tags that are used with the <table> tag are <tr>, <td>, and <th>.
			- <table> Tag: This tag is used to create the table that wrap the rows and columns within it.
			- <tr> Tag: Stands for "table row" and is used to create a row within the table.
			- <td> Tag: Represents "table data" and is used to create standard cells within a row.
			- <th> Tag: Represents "table header" and is used to create header cells within a row.
		
		Rows, Each row in an HTML table is defined using the `<tr>` tag. It contains a set of table cells 
		(`<td>` or `<th>`), representing the individual elements within that row.

		Columns: The actual data or header information is contained within the table cells. Cells in the same position in 
		different rows form a column.
			A table row is defined by the <tr> tag. 
			To set table header, we use <th> tag. 
			To insert data in table cell, use the <td> tag.

		A table in HTML consists of table cells inside rows and columns of the table.
		Table heading is defined by the <th>...</th>. Data inside the <th> are the headings of the column of a table.
		Each table cell is defined by a <td>...</td> tag. Data inside the <td> tag are the content of the table rows and columns.
		Each table row starts with a <tr> ....</tr> tag.
		We use style sheet to create border for the table.
		
		Consider a table representing a simple list of products with their respective categories and prices. This basic table structure organizes data in a clear, tabular format, making it easy to read and understand. Here, the border is an attribute of <table> tag and it is used to put a border across all the cells. If you do not need a border, then you can use border="0".

		You can also style an HTML table using CSS properties to give it a custom appearance. Either you can create classes 
		to apply styles on a table, or you can simply write internal CSS properties to style the table.

		You can set the background color and background image of an HTML table by using the CSS and attributes of the 
		<table> tag. Using table tag's attributes is an old (outdated) style. It is recommended that you should use CSS to 
		style an HTML table. The background-color and background-image properties are used to set background color and 
		image respectively.
		
		The table's width and height can be set using either attributes or CSS properties.
		These values can be defined in pixels or percentages.

		Nested HTML tables refer to create tables inside a table. You can create tables inside a table by using the <table> 
		tab inside any <td> tag, it creates another table in the main table's cell.

		The following are the table-related tags.
			- <table>........	It is used to create HTML table.	
			- <thead>........	This tag is used to define table header section.	
			- <tbody>........	This tag is used to define table body section.	
			- <tfoot>........	This tag is used to define the table footer section.	
			- <th>...........	This tag defines the header of the table.	
			- <tr>...........	This tag defines a table row.	
			- <col>..........	This tag is used to offer information about columns.	
			- <colgroup>.....	This tag describes the collection of one or more columns in a table for formattig.	
			- <td>...........	This tag is used to store table data of each cell.	
			- <caption>......	This tag specifies the caption for the table.

	<table border="">
		<tr>
			<th>Column Head 1</th>
			<th>Column Head 2</th>
			<th>Column Head 3</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Row 01, Column 01</td>
			<td>Row 01, Column 02</td>
			<td>Row 01, Column 03</td>
